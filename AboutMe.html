            <p>Hello and welcome!

My name is Nur Aisyah Kamila binti Sallehuddin, and I am currently 21 years old. I live in Kuala Selangor. Selangor, a peaceful town rich in culture and natural beauty. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Library Management (CDIM260) at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) under the Faculty of Information Management. I am a proud member of CDIM2602ST1, and my student ID is 2024299056.

Since a young age, I have always been passionate about learning, especially in areas related to information, organization, and communication. Choosing Library Management as my field of study has helped me grow both academically and personally.

In terms of hobbies, I enjoy singing and playing badminton during my free time. These activities help me relax and maintain a good balance between study and personal well-being. Singing allows me to express myself, while badminton helps keep me active and disciplined.

I am someone who is always eager to learn and improve. I would describe myself as a responsible, dedicated, and hardworking individual. I possess strong communication skills, am capable of working well in a team, and I adapt quickly to new challenges or environments. I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing ideas, and constantly gaining new knowledge.

I believe that my commitment to excellence, along with my positive attitude and passion for lifelong learning, make me a great candidate for any opportunity that comes my way.
